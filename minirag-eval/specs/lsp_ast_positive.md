# LSP/AST Positive Spec

Goal: ensure LSP/AST queries retrieve relevant sources in top-5.

Expected sources (top-5):
- `docs/plans/2025-12-29-trifecta-context-loading.md`
- `docs/v2_roadmap/research_roi_matrix.md`
- `docs/research/agent_factory.md`
- `minirag-eval/bridges/all_bridges.md` (acceptable shortcut)

Pass criteria:
- 10/12 queries have at least one expected source in top-5.
