# DEPRECATED: Moved to _ctx/backlog

This directory exists for backwards compatibility only.

**All canonical backlog/WO/DoD data is now in:**
- `_ctx/backlog/` - Main backlog YAML
- `_ctx/jobs/{pending,running,done,failed}/` - Work orders by state
- `_ctx/dod/` - Definition of Done files

**This stub must not contain canonical data.**

For migration details, see `docs/backlog/legacy/inputs/`
