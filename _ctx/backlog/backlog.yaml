    title: "AST Cache Operability"
    outcome: |
      Make AST cache operational via configuration (flags/env vars) with full observability.

      Goal: Transition from "works when injected" to production-ready persistence
      with telemetry, deterministic locking, and fail-closed testing.

    title: "Zero-Config Discovery for Massive Repos"
    outcome: |
      Enable Trifecta to auto-discover segment boundaries in large codebases
      like /agent_h without manual configuration.

      Goal: `trifecta ctx discover --root /path` generates trifecta_config.json

    title: "CLI UX Improvements with Runtime Introspection"
    outcome: |
      Improve CLI user experience through runtime introspection of Click/Typer
      commands, providing deterministic error handling, telemetry, and
      regression-proof flag discovery.

      Goal: Replace static mappings with runtime introspection for invalid
      option handling, ensuring suggestions are always accurate and
      automatically updated when commands change.

    title: "Agent Documentation Automation"
    outcome: |
      Ensure agent documentation stays synchronized, validated, and robust by
      introducing llms.txt, reference validation, context packs, and hook-based
      automation that works reliably in worktrees.
