Top Missed Tasks (fallback): 9 total
  1. the thing for loading context
  2. how does it work
  3. telemetry
  4. where to find code
  5. architecture

Examples (hits with selected_feature):
  1. [nl_trigger] 'can you show me the token counting logic'
     → token_estimation (2 chunks, 0 paths)
  2. [nl_trigger] 'where would i find stats about search performance'
     → observability_telemetry (3 chunks, 0 paths)
  3. [alias] 'explain how primes organize the reading list'
     → prime_indexing (3 chunks, 0 paths)

❌ NO-GO (Gate-NL): Some criteria failed
   ✗ fallback_rate 22.5% >= 20%
   ✗ feature_hit_rate 0.0% < 10% (informative)

Passed criteria:
   ✓ true_zero_guidance_rate 0.0% = 0%
   ✓ alias_hit_rate 30.0% <= 70%
