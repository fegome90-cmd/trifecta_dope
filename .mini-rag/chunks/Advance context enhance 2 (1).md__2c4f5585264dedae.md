## Conclusion

Advanced Context Use is a mindset shift: from documents to invokable capabilities.

Don’t load everything “just in case.” Give the agent a map and two buttons: search and retrieve evidence. If you want real fluidity with files that change frequently, AST/LSP turn `ctx.search` into something more like an IDE than grep.

The 1:1 match with advanced tool use:

- **Tool Search** → **Context Search**
- **Programmatic Tool Calling** → **Programmatic Context Calling**
- **Tool Use Examples** → **Context Use Examples**

Apply the feature that solves your biggest bottleneck first. For most systems, that’s Context Search (cuts upfront bloat). Then add Programmatic Calling (prevents intermediate pollution) and Examples (reduces usage errors).

Keep context as evidence, not instructions. Enforce hard budgets and maximum rounds. Measure with clear metrics.
