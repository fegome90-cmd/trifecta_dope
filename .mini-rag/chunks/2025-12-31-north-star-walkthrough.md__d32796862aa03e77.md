## 🎯 What Was Built

A **deterministic validation gate** that enforces the North Star structure (3+1 files) with **Functional Programming** safety. The system ensures **no exceptions in business logic; errors are values (Ok/Err). Exceptions allowed only at boundaries (CLI exits) and in tests.** It enforces a "Fail-Closed" policy for legacy files and naming ambiguity.
