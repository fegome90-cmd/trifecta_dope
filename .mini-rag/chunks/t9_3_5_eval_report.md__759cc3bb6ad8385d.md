## Gate Status

| Gate | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Core Gate-NL** | ❌ **NO-GO** | fallback 22.5% >= 20% (fail), alias 35.0% <= 70% (pass), true_zero 0% (pass) |

**Overall Assessment**: T9.3.5 clamp behavior is explicit and telemetry fields are present, but eval metrics regressed.
