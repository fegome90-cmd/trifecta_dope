## Conclusion

**Acceptance Criteria**: ❌ NOT MET

Target was <20% zero-hits using ctx.plan alone.
Results show 45% plan_miss rate.

**However**, combined with entrypoints fallback, the system provides guidance for all 20 tasks.

**Recommendations**:
1. Expand feature_map with more specific features
2. Add more keywords per feature
3. Consider hierarchical feature matching
4. The entrypoints fallback is working well
