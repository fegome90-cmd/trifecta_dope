## Top Missed Tasks (Expected Fallbacks)

All 7 remaining fallbacks are truly ambiguous queries with insufficient context:

| # | Task | Why Fallback |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | "the thing for loading context" | "the thing" - no specific keywords |
| 2 | "how does it work" | No domain context |
| 3 | "telemetry" | Single keyword, no intent |
| 4 | "where to find code" | Too vague, no specific domain |
| 5 | "architecture" | Single keyword, no context |
| 6 | "implement something" | "something" - no specific target |
| 7 | "telemetry architecture overview" | Multi-concept, could match multiple features |

These are expected fallbacks - the 10 ambiguous tasks in the dataset were designed to test robustness against poor queries.
