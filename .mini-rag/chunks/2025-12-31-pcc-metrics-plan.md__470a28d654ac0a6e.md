Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/2025-12-31-pcc-metrics-plan.md`. Two execution options:

1. Subagent-Driven (this session) — I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration
2. Parallel Session (separate) — Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints

Which approach?
