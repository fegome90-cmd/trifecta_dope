## 3. Context Use Examples: Teaching Correct Usage

Schemas define what’s valid; they don’t define what works well. Anthropic emphasizes this: examples teach patterns—when to use optional parameters, what combinations make sense, conventions.

The same applies to context:

- The agent might request too much (`mode="raw"` always)
- Or request poorly (“give me all of skill.md”)
- Or loop infinitely (repeated searches)
