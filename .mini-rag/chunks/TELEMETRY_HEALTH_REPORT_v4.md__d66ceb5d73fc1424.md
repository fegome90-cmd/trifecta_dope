## 5. Final Verdict

**Production Status**: ✅ **READY**

**Justification**:
- "High Error Rate" was an analysis artifact, not a system fault.
- "Real" subset (n=39) shows 100% success.
- Feature gating (Error Cards) works as expected (`SEGMENT_NOT_INITIALIZED`).

**Sign-off**: Telemetry data is valid for release decisions, provided the test-bias warning is heeded.
